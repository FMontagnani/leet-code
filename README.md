## 📚 About This Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This collection represents my journey through algorithmic problem-solving, featuring solutions implemented in various programming languages. Each solution is crafted with clarity, efficiency, and best practices in mind.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

```
leet-code/
├── node/           # JavaScript/TypeScript solutions
├── python/         # Python solutions
├── c-sharp         # C# solutions
└── README.md       # This file
```

### 📁 Language Folders

Each programming language has its own dedicated folder containing:
- Individual solution files named after the challenge
- Language-specific README with setup instructions
- Examples and test cases where applicable

### 📄 File Naming Convention

Solutions are named using the following format:
```
<problem-number>-<problem-name>.<extension>
```

**Examples:**
- `1-two-sum.js`
- `2-add-two-numbers.py`
- `3-longest-substring-without-repeating-characters.cpp`
